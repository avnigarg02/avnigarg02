### Hi there 👋

I'm Avni Garg: math enthusiast, programmer, and senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (<a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu" target="_blank">TJHSST</a>). \
➕ I'm the co-captain for the <a href="https://tjvmt.com" target="_blank">TJ Varsity Math Team</a>, one of the most successful high school math teams in the nation! \
🖥️ I'm also the teaching coordinator for the <a href="https://activities.tjhsst.edu/sct/" target="_blank">TJ Senior Computer Team</a> \
👩‍💻 I'm part of the <a href="https://github.com/HackTJ" target="_blank">HackTJ</a> organizing team, the largest high school hackathon on the east-coast, where I primarly work on the judging systems. 

Here you can find some of my current and past projects including:
 - 💹 MRIO Analysis (mrio-analysis): Assess environmental impact of the global economy using a quantum Bayesian-adapted model. In progress as part of the Quantum and Optics Lab at TJHSST.
 - 💪 NeuroFlex (neuroflex): Aid in ALS diagnosis creating cost-effective surface EMG. Connects to app via the BLE protocol. This project was a 2024 Conrad Challenge Innovation Summit Finalist.
 - 🔎 UAV Search and Rescue (uav-sar): Utilize survival behavioral models to optimize path plotting for search and rescue UAVs. This project received Honorable Mention and was an alternate for regionals at the TJHSST Science Fair.
 - 💻 TNN (tnn): A novel variant of the KNN algorithm.
 - 🌳 Carbon Blueprint (carbon-blueprint): Carbon tracking app using EPA's carbon footprint calculator.
 - 📵 PirateTime (pirate-time): Reward users for following their screen time limit. Collect coins and compete with friends!
 - 🩸 DonoBlood (donoblood): Blockchain based architecture to encourage blood donations.
 - 🦟 ArboTrack (arbotrack-cnn): Combat mosquito borne diseases with a crowd-sourced app. This project was a 2020 eCYBERMISSION National Finalist. Developed a deep learning image classification model to detect standing water from false reports as part of eCYBERMISSION's STEM-in-Action Grant.
